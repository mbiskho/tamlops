Machine learning has fundamentally transformed various industries and applications, ushering in a new era in data utilization. Its ability to recognize patterns and analyze information from large datasets has revolutionized numerous fields. However, with the rapid growth in the realm of machine learning, increasingly complex and larger models pose challenges in their training and management processes. This presents unique challenges in implementing MLOps on a large scale. To meet a company's Service Level Objective (SLO), a scheduling algorithm capable of expediting these processes is required. Moreover, comprehensive testing is necessary to measure the effectiveness of the scheduling algorithm. In this context, chaos engineering can assess the system's efficacy alongside the applied scheduling algorithm.
